### **About the Project**

*EcoWise* is a web-based application I developed to help individuals track, reduce, and offset their carbon footprints. The increasing urgency of climate change and the need for individual responsibility inspired me to create this project. Many people want to live more sustainably but lack the tools or guidance. My goal was to build a simple yet impactful tool that offers personalized insights and encourages actionable change.

The app aims to empower users by giving them data-driven feedback on their daily activities and offering ways to reduce their carbon emissions. EcoWise also fosters community by allowing users to participate in challenges that promote environmental action.
